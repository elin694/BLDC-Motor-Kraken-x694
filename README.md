# In Progress :)
Hello! In this repository, I have saved my in progress work of my BLDC Motor project!

#Goal
The Goal of this project is to use as many parts that I have scavenged and lying around to make a mock-Kraken X60, a popular FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) motor. That involves:
- A 28 gauge enameled copper wire from BingoTech
- 10mmx5mmx40mm neodymium 52 magnets
- 3D printed parts (from the NYC First Stem Center)
- Parts from the ELEGOO Arduino Starter Kit
- and many more.
While I tried my best to make my part as close as possible to real motor (in size and shape), there were certain limitations that forced me to bend the rules a little- I didn't have a spline  XS shaft, nor could I have manufactured one (I couldn't find any scrap Kraken X60's either), so I replaced it with a 1/2" hex shaft.
>Ultimately, the goal is to make a really cheap version of the actual motor that is as accurate as possible so I can confuse my friends, but also as a gift/homage to team 694.

Designing the part:
As per the Dunning-Kruger effect, I originally thought this was going to be an easy project-as seen in the images below (I underestimate wire space and how much I needed, tolerance, wiring, and magnet size).
